Distribute the Framework as a Visual Studio Add-In, like BIDS Helper (Maybe even incorporate it to BIDS Helper?)
Include all the BIML templates into the Helper Project, this will keep them in sync with the code base
Design all template classes to generate its Biml code and allow the code to be overwritten in its entirity
Generate an SSIS package by aggregating all the Biml code from each of the classes in the hierarchy
	Example
		Project
			Generate project connections and any other project scoped elements
			For Each Package
				Generate SSIS package and any other package scoped elements
				For Each Task
					For Each Data Flow
						For Each ...


Question?
	Are we duplicating the class hierarchy already present in the Biml Engine ?
	Where is the value in all of this code?
		The predefined Biml templates and the json generation from database speeds up ETL development.
